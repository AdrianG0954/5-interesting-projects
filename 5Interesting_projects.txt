I find this interesting because I always wondered what kind of code and software is used in face swap
I find face swap very interesting and I am very excited to know what kind of
work goes into these sorts of things. While I still have a lot to go from now to there
I think this is a good beginning exercise in finding out how this is made.

internships to me are very important because while still being in school I can be
aquiring valuable experience which can and will only help me in the future.
I do not think I will apply for an internship this year and will focus on furthing
my education and learning as much as I can about c++ and python.

python is a very important language to me as that is what I use for all my 
interview questions. I started learning it about a week ago and I just love how
simple and great the syntax is. I plan on using python for my technical interviews 
and wouldnt be against someday making something with it as a fun side project.

since this month we are building a calculator I wanted to see how someone 
obviously more experienced than I handled that task. I am very excited to 
build this calculator and I will make sure to put in 100% while making it.

emulators have always been very interesting to me because I would always wonder 
how someone could even think about getting one working. programming is still very
insane to me because of how many things are possible using it and how creative people
are with their knowledge. I one day hope to be as skilled as other people are but
one can only dream. I chose this because I wanted to see what went into building an
emulator and the test/ improvments that were done to it overtime
